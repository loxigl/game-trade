      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project infrastructure setup into logical phases focusing on: 1) repository structure, 2) local development environment, 3) database setup, 4) messaging systems, 5) frontend initialization, 6) deployment configuration, and 7) monitoring setup. For each phase, identify specific technical tasks, potential challenges, and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up multiple complex infrastructure components (Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Next.js, CI/CD) that span both frontend and backend. Each component requires specialized knowledge and has its own configuration challenges. The task also establishes the foundation for the entire project, making it critical to get right."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create database schema with dynamic categorization support",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the database schema implementation into: 1) core entity design, 2) dynamic categorization system, 3) indexing and optimization strategy, 4) ORM implementation and migrations, and 5) search functionality. For each area, detail the specific tables/models needed, relationships between them, and how they support the dynamic nature of the marketplace.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires designing a complex database schema that must support dynamic categorization across different games, each with custom attributes. The implementation includes not just database design but also ORM models, migrations, validation rules, and search indexing. The dynamic nature adds significant complexity as the schema must be flexible yet performant."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop marketplace core functionality",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the marketplace core functionality into: 1) listing management backend, 2) search and filtering system, 3) media handling for listings, 4) frontend listing creation and management, and 5) browsing and discovery features. For each component, specify the API endpoints needed, data validation requirements, and user interface considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing the core marketplace functionality with complex search, filtering, and dynamic attribute validation. It requires both backend API development and frontend UI components. The search functionality with Elasticsearch adds complexity, as does handling dynamic attributes based on category rules."

      "taskTitle": "Implement transaction and Escrow system",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the transaction and escrow system into: 1) transaction model and state machine, 2) escrow mechanism, 3) transaction workflow API endpoints, 4) timeout and failure handling, 5) event system for state changes, and 6) frontend transaction flow. For each component, detail the security considerations, edge cases to handle, and testing scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "The transaction system is highly complex and financially critical, requiring a secure escrow mechanism with multiple state transitions. It must handle edge cases like timeouts and disputes while maintaining data integrity. The event-driven nature adds complexity, as does the need for a seamless frontend experience for a critical user journey."

      "taskTitle": "Build wallet and payment integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the wallet and payment system into: 1) wallet data model and operations, 2) deposit flow with Stripe, 3) withdrawal processing, 4) transaction history and reporting, and 5) security measures. For each component, specify the integration points with external services, error handling approaches, and compliance requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves handling real money transactions with third-party payment provider integration (Stripe). It requires implementing secure multi-currency wallets, payment processing, and withdrawal verification. Financial operations demand high security, proper error handling, and compliance with financial regulations."

For each component, detail the performance considerations, scaling approach, and user experience requirements.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a real-time chat system requires WebSocket server setup, message persistence, and handling different message types. The system must track read/unread status and support image uploads. While complex, the scope is more contained than some other tasks, focusing specifically on communication functionality."
