# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Secure Chat System for Transaction Communication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a real-time chat system that enables direct communication between buyers and sellers to discuss transaction details, with moderation capabilities for dispute resolution.
# Details:
Create a secure, real-time chat system with the following features:

1. Private chat rooms automatically created for each transaction between buyer and seller
2. Message persistence in database with proper indexing for performance
3. Support for text messages, with potential extension for file/image sharing
4. Read receipts and typing indicators
5. Message timestamp display and conversation history
6. Moderation tools allowing authorized staff to:
   - View chat histories for disputed transactions
   - Flag inappropriate content
   - Lock chats during investigation
   - Add notes visible only to other moderators
7. Notification integration with the existing notification system (Task #8)
8. Chat UI components for both web and mobile interfaces
9. Message encryption for security
10. Rate limiting to prevent spam
11. Clear indication when a moderator joins a conversation
12. Ability to export chat logs as evidence

Technical implementation should use WebSockets for real-time communication, with a fallback to polling if WebSockets aren't supported. Consider using a service like Socket.io or a message broker like RabbitMQ for handling the real-time aspects.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover the following areas:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test message sending/receiving logic
   - Test database operations for message persistence
   - Test moderation functions and permissions

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify WebSocket connections establish correctly
   - Confirm messages flow between different users
   - Test notification integration
   - Verify moderator access controls

3. End-to-end tests:
   - Complete conversation flows between buyer and seller
   - Moderator intervention scenarios
   - Chat history loading and pagination

4. Performance tests:
   - Message delivery latency under various loads
   - Database query performance with large message history
   - Connection handling with many simultaneous users

5. Security tests:
   - Verify chat privacy (users can only access their own chats)
   - Test for XSS vulnerabilities in message display
   - Verify encryption implementation
   - Test rate limiting effectiveness

Manual testing should include dispute resolution scenarios with test moderator accounts to ensure the complete workflow functions as expected.
