# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement transaction and Escrow system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the transaction processing system with Escrow functionality to ensure secure trading between users.
# Details:
1. Create transaction model and API endpoints
2. Implement Escrow mechanism for holding funds
3. Develop transaction status flow (PENDING → ESCROW_HELD → COMPLETED/REFUNDED/DISPUTED)
4. Add transaction confirmation and completion endpoints
5. Implement timeout handling for transactions
6. Create event publishing for transaction state changes
7. Develop frontend transaction flow (purchase, confirmation, completion)
8. Add transaction history for users
9. Implement transaction details page
10. Create system for handling transaction failures

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for transaction state transitions
2. Integration tests for the complete transaction flow
3. Test Escrow mechanism with various scenarios
4. Verify timeout handling and automatic actions
5. Test event publishing for transaction state changes
6. End-to-end testing of the purchase flow

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create transaction data model and database schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core transaction data model with all necessary fields to support the Escrow flow and transaction states
### Details:
Create a Transaction model with fields: id, buyer_id, seller_id, item_id, amount, fee, status (enum: PENDING, ESCROW_HELD, COMPLETED, REFUNDED, DISPUTED), created_at, updated_at, completion_deadline, notes, and metadata. Include foreign key relationships to users and items. Add database indexes for efficient querying by user, status, and date ranges. Implement validation rules to ensure data integrity. Create database migration scripts for the new schema.

## 2. Implement core transaction API endpoints and Escrow mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop the essential API endpoints for transaction creation and the Escrow holding mechanism
### Details:
Create REST API endpoints for: 1) Transaction creation (POST /transactions) with payment processing integration, 2) Transaction status retrieval (GET /transactions/{id}), 3) Implement the Escrow holding mechanism that securely reserves funds when a transaction is created, moving from PENDING to ESCROW_HELD state. Include proper error handling for payment failures. Implement database transactions to ensure atomicity. Add authentication middleware to verify user permissions for each endpoint.

## 3. Develop transaction state management and event system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Implement the state transition logic and event publishing system for transaction lifecycle events
### Details:
Create a TransactionStateManager service that handles all state transitions with validation rules. Implement event publishing for state changes (transaction.created, transaction.escrow_held, transaction.completed, transaction.refunded, transaction.disputed). Add transaction timeout handling using a scheduled job that checks for expired transactions and automatically triggers appropriate state changes. Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate processing. Create comprehensive logging for all state changes for audit purposes.

## 4. Implement transaction completion and dispute handling endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Create API endpoints for finalizing transactions, handling disputes, and processing refunds
### Details:
Implement endpoints for: 1) Transaction completion (POST /transactions/{id}/complete) that releases funds from Escrow to seller, 2) Dispute creation (POST /transactions/{id}/dispute) with reason codes and evidence submission, 3) Refund processing (POST /transactions/{id}/refund) with full and partial refund support. Add admin endpoints for dispute resolution. Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized completion attempts. Create notification triggers for all major state changes to alert relevant users.

## 5. Develop frontend transaction flow and user interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Create the user interface components for the entire transaction lifecycle
### Details:
Implement frontend components for: 1) Transaction initiation with payment method selection, 2) Transaction confirmation page with details and terms, 3) Transaction status tracking interface with real-time updates, 4) Completion confirmation flow, 5) Dispute submission form with evidence upload, 6) Transaction history list with filtering and sorting. Use optimistic UI updates combined with backend validation. Implement proper error handling and user feedback. Create responsive designs that work across device sizes.

## 6. Implement transaction history and reporting system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5
### Description: Create comprehensive transaction history, details pages, and reporting functionality
### Details:
Develop transaction history pages for both buyers and sellers with filtering options (date range, status, counterparty). Create detailed transaction view showing complete timeline of events, messages, and state changes. Implement CSV/PDF export functionality for transaction records. Add analytics dashboard for admins showing transaction volumes, success rates, dispute frequency, and other KPIs. Implement data retention policies and archiving for older transactions. Create automated reconciliation reports for accounting purposes.
